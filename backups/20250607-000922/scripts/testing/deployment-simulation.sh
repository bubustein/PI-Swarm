echo "================================="
echo "1. ✅ Prerequisites check and installation"
echo "2. 🔍 Pi discovery and validation"
echo "3. 🔧 Pi configuration (Docker, SSH, etc.)"
echo "4. 🗄️  STORAGE SETUP:"
echo "   • Auto-detect 250GB SSDs on each Pi"
echo "   • Install GlusterFS on all nodes"
echo "   • Format and mount SSDs"
echo "   • Create GlusterFS cluster"
echo "   • Mount shared storage on all nodes"
echo "   • Configure Docker to use shared storage"
echo "5. 🐳 Docker Swarm initialization"
echo "6. 📦 Service deployment with shared volumes"
echo "7. 📊 Monitoring and validation"

echo "🗄️  Storage Benefits:"
echo "===================="
echo "• High availability: Data replicated across all Pis"
echo "• Scalability: Easy to add more storage nodes"
echo "• Performance: Distributed reads/writes"
echo "• Reliability: Automatic failover if a Pi goes down"
echo "• Docker integration: Persistent volumes across the cluster"
