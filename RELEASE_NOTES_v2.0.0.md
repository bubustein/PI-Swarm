# Pi-Swarm v2.0.0 Release Notes

## Release Date: 2025-05-31

### Overview
This release marks a major milestone for Pi-Swarm, making it robust, reproducible, and ready for public/open-source deployment. All deployment blockers, configuration issues, and function loading problems have been resolved. The project now supports modern Docker Compose, improved error handling, and comprehensive testing.

## Key Changes
- **Project Restructuring:** All scripts and functions are now organized by scope for clarity and maintainability.
- **Modern Docker Support:** Uses Docker Compose V2 plugin by default, with fallback to manual install if needed.
- **Robust File Copying:** All required config files and templates are copied from the correct locations.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** 
  - SSH key setup failures are now warnings instead of fatal errors
  - Better connectivity validation with graceful degradation
  - Improved error messages throughout the deployment process
  - SSL setup only runs when explicitly enabled
- **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive test and deployment scripts ensure project integrity and reproducibility.
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and CI badge in documentation.
- **Documentation:** All docs, contributing, security, FAQ, and troubleshooting guides updated for open-source readiness.
- **Deployment Summary:** Added comprehensive deployment summary with status checks and next steps guidance.

## Migration Guide
- Remove any old Docker Compose (pip-based) installations from Pis before upgrading.
- Use the new deployment scripts for all future installations.
- See the new `scripts/testing/comprehensive-test.sh` and `test-deployment.sh` for validation and CI.

## Upgrade Path
1. Pull the latest code from GitHub.
2. Run the comprehensive test script to validate your environment:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/testing/comprehensive-test.sh
   ```
3. Use the deployment script as documented in the README.

## Known Issues
- SSH key setup may fail if Pis are not accessible or credentials are incorrect (now handled gracefully with fallback to password auth).
- Some enterprise features require additional configuration (see docs/ENTERPRISE_FEATURES.md).
- Service deployment may fail if Pis are not powered on or network connectivity is poor (deployment script now provides clear feedback).
