## üöÄ Usage Scenarios

### Option 1: Enhanced Interactive Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy.sh
# Choose option 2
# Select "Y" for pre-deployment validation
```

### Option 2: Automated Deployment with Validation
```bash
./deploy.sh
# Choose option 1
# Validation runs automatically
```

### Option 3: Traditional Deployment with Optional Validation
```bash
./deploy.sh
# Choose option 3
# Select "Y" for pre-deployment validation
```

### Option 4: Standalone Validation Only
```bash
./deploy.sh
# Choose option 5
# OR directly: ./scripts/testing/pre-deployment-validation-only.sh
```

## üìã Validation Process Details

The pre-deployment validation performs:

1. **Phase 1: Basic System Validation**
   - SSH connectivity tests
   - Ping responsiveness checks
   - Authentication verification

2. **Phase 2: System Resource Validation**
   - Disk space analysis (minimum 2GB free)
   - Memory availability checks
   - System load assessment

3. **Phase 3: Docker Environment Cleanup**
   - Remove old containers and images
   - Clean unused networks and volumes
   - Stop conflicting services
   - Reset Docker state

4. **Phase 4: Network Requirements Validation**
   - Inter-Pi connectivity tests
   - Port availability checks
   - Network interface validation

5. **Phase 5: Security and SSH Validation**
   - SSH key configuration
   - Firewall status checks
   - Security settings validation

6. **Phase 6: System Optimization**
   - Memory optimization
   - Performance tuning
   - Service preparation

## üß™ Testing Verification

All integration points have been tested:

- ‚úÖ Script syntax validation
