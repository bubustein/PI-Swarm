## Integration Points

### 1. **Main Deployment Script** (`deploy.sh`)
```bash
# Enhanced Python integration
if [[ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/python_integration.sh" ]]; then
    source "$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/python_integration.sh"
    health_check_comprehensive
fi
```

### 2. **Enhanced Deployment** (`scripts/deployment/enhanced-deploy.sh`)
```bash
# Enhanced validation with Python modules
if [[ "$PYTHON_ENHANCED" == "true" ]]; then
    validate_and_prepare_pi_state_enhanced "${pi_array[@]}"
fi
```

### 3. **Pre-deployment Validation** (`lib/deployment/pre_deployment_validation.sh`)
```bash
# Comprehensive Python-based validation
validate_and_prepare_pi_state_enhanced() {
    health_check_comprehensive
    manage_storage_comprehensive validate
    manage_security_comprehensive audit
}
```

## Quality Assurance
