## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Prerequisites:**
1. **Raspberry Pi nodes** running Raspberry Pi OS
2. **SSH access** configured on all nodes
3. **Network connectivity** between all nodes
4. **Internet access** for Docker image downloads

### **Quick Start:**
```bash
# 1. Clone or download the Pi-Swarm repository
git clone <repository-url> && cd PI-Swarm

# 2. Run the enhanced deployment script
sudo ./swarm-cluster.sh

# 3. Choose enterprise setup option:
#    - "y" for ALL enterprise features (recommended)
#    - "N" for individual feature selection
#    
#    If "yes to all": Provide domain, email, webhook URLs
#    System will auto-configure: SSL, alerts, HA, templates

# 4. Access your cluster (URLs will use your actual IPs):
#    - Portainer: https://[your-manager-ip]:9443
#    - Grafana: http://[your-manager-ip]:3000
#    - Prometheus: http://[your-manager-ip]:9090

# 5. Use the management CLI:
./pi-swarm status              # Shows actual cluster IPs
./pi-swarm monitor             # Real-time monitoring
./pi-swarm templates           # Available service templates
```

### **Enterprise "Yes to All" Setup:**
When you choose "Enable ALL enterprise features", the system will:
1. **Auto-configure** SSL automation, multi-channel alerts, HA, templates
2. **Prompt only for required inputs** (domain, email, webhook URLs)
3. **Deploy complete enterprise stack** with all features enabled
4. **Generate dynamic configuration** using your actual cluster IPs
5. **Provide immediate access** to all enterprise capabilities

### **Management Commands:**
```bash
# Cluster Operations
./pi-swarm status              # Show cluster health with actual IPs
./pi-swarm nodes               # List all nodes with live status
./pi-swarm services            # Show running services
